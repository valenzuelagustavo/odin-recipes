            <h1>Kimchi Jigae (Kimchi Stew)</h1>

            <p><strong>Kimchi Jjigae</strong>, or Kimchi Stew, is a beloved Korean comfort food. It's a hearty and spicy soup made primarily from kimchi (fermented cabbage) and often includes pork or tofu, onions, garlic, and green onions. The base of the soup is rich with flavors from gochujang (Korean red chili paste) and gochugaru (Korean red chili flakes), which give it its signature kick. <strong>Kimchi Jjigae</strong> is traditionally simmered until all the ingredients meld together, creating a deeply flavorful and warming dish. It's commonly served with a bowl of steamed rice and is perfect for colder days or when you're craving something with a bit of heat. The combination of tangy, spicy, and savory flavors makes it a staple in Korean cuisine.</p>

                        <li>If using enoki mushrooms and tofu, add them to the pot during the last 10 minutes of cooking. Simmer until the tofu is heated through and the mushrooms are tender.</li>
