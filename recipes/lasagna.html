    <h1>Lasagna</h1>

    <p>Lasagna is a classic <strong>Italian dish</strong> made with layers of wide, flat pasta sheets, rich meat or vegetable sauce, creamy b√©chamel or ricotta cheese, and melted cheese, typically mozzarella and Parmesan. The dish is baked until golden and bubbling, resulting in a hearty, flavorful meal with a perfect balance of textures. Traditional lasagna often includes a slow-cooked rag√π (such as Bolognese) and a tomato-based sauce, though variations exist, including vegetarian, seafood, and white sauce versions. It is a comfort <em>food favorite</em> worldwide, known for its satisfying layers and deep, savory flavors.</p>
