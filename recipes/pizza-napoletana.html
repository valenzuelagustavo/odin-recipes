    <h1>Pizza Napoletana</h1>

    <p>Pizza Napoletana, or Neapolitan Pizza, is a traditional Italian pizza originating from Naples. It's characterized by its thin, soft crust, which is slightly crispy on the outside and tender on the inside. The dough is made from just a few simple ingredients: water, flour, salt, and yeast, and is left to ferment for several hours to develop its unique flavor and texture.</p>

                <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
                <li>1/2 teaspoon active dry yeast</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><b>For the toppings:</b>
            <ul>
                <li>1 1/2 cups (350ml) tomato sauce (preferably San Marzano tomatoes, crushed)</li>
                <li>8 ounces (225g) fresh mozzarella cheese, sliced</li>
                <li>Fresh basil leaves</li>
                <li>Extra virgin olive oil</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Instructions:</h2>

    <ol>
        <li><b>Prepare the dough:</b>
            <ul>
                <li>In a large mixing bowl, combine flour, water, salt, and yeast. Mix until a dough forms.</li>
                <li>Knead the dough on a lightly floured surface for about 10 minutes, until smooth and elastic.</li>
                <li>Place the dough in a bowl, cover it with a damp cloth, and let it rise for at least 6 hours, or until it doubles in size.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><b>Shape the dough:</b>
            <ul>
                <li>Preheat your oven to its highest temperature (around 475¬∞F to 500¬∞F, or 245¬∞C to 260¬∞C).</li>
                <li>Divide the dough into four equal parts. Shape each part into a ball and let them rest for 10 minutes.</li>
                <li>On a floured surface, stretch each dough ball into a 10-12 inch circle, being careful not to flatten the edges too much to maintain the crust.</li>
            </ul>        
        </li>
        <li><b>Assemble the pizza:</b>
            <ul>
                <li>Spread a thin layer of tomato sauce over the dough, leaving a small border around the edges.</li>
                <li>Arrange the mozzarella slices evenly over the sauce.</li>
                <li>Add a few fresh basil leaves on top.</li>
            </ul>       
        </li>
        <li><b>Bake the pizza:</b>
            <ul>
                <li>Transfer the pizza to a baking stone or an inverted baking sheet (preheated in the oven) to get that authentic crispy crust.</li>
                <li>Bake for about 8-12 minutes, or until the crust is golden and the cheese is bubbly and slightly browned.</li>
            </ul>        
        </li>
        <li><b>Finish and serve:</b>
            <ul>
                <li>Remove the pizza from the oven, drizzle with a little extra virgin olive oil, and add a few more fresh basil leaves if desired.</li>
                <li>Slice and serve immediately.</li>
            </ul>       
        </li>
    </ol>
